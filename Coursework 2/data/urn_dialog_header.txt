You have been given a chance to win 30 GBP!

You have been randomly given one of 3 urn sizes: 2, 10 and 100 balls.
A ball will be randomly drawn from one of the two urns displayed below.

If a blue ball is drawn, you will be entered into the 30GBP lottery! If a red ball is drawn, you lose.
One of the urns contains balls with an unknown distribution of red and blue (indicated as black balls).
This can range from 100 red and 0 blues to 0 reds and 100 blues.
The other urn has a 50:50 distribution of red and blue balls.

Note: The mixture of red and blue balls in the unknown urn has been randomly generated and every possible combination is equally likely.

Please click on the urn for where you would like the ball to be drawn from.
